def longest_ones(A, K):
    """
    Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

    Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

    Example 1:
    Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.


    Example 2:
    Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: 
    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

    Note:
    `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
    `0 <= K <= A.length`
    `A[i]` is `0` or `1`
